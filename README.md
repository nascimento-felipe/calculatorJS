<h1 align="center">JS Calculator</h1>

<p>This project is a calculator with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's almost done, but it isn't doing sequential equations, like typing "2+2 =" and then "+ 3" will cause a bug in the logic, But i'm working on it.</p>
<p>The equation with two 'bodies' is working fine, try "2+2" and you will have the "4" output once you click in the equal button.</p>
<p>It's not the most beautiful calculator in the world, but is <strong>my</strong> calculator.</p>
