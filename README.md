<h1 align="center">JS Calculator</h1>

<p>This project is a calculator with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's almost done, but it's doing only sum equations. The reason I don't know yet, but I will figure out.</p>
<p>The sum equations is working fine, fell free to test it.</p>
<p>PS: it has not error handling, i'll do it when all the functionalities are working.</p>
<p>It's not the most beautiful calculator in the world, but is <strong>my</strong> calculator.</p>
